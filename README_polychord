Running PolyChord version 1.15

##################
#For the cluster #
##################

As a test, using base2015_ns.param, which requires planck likelihood. Already installed globally, in:

    /lustren/hpcwork/dh573265/plc-2.0/bin/clik_profile.zsh

I use gcc compilers (they work better with MultiNest and MontePython), but they are not the default. To switch:

    module unload intel
    module unload openmpi
    module load gcc
    module load openmpi
    module load python

To launch a script on the cluster, use

    bsub -P rwth0113 < montepython_polychord/pctest.sh

To monitor the job

    bjobs

If you want to kill the job

    bkill #JOBID

The paths in the script might  need to be updated (except for the Planck likelihood, that one is fine). When submitting the job, it normally runs without giving any error messages, but does not write anything to the output files. When running front-end (directly in the command line, without submitting the job), I get a segfault after a few hours.

The Planck likelihood can be found at:

    /home/ballardini/planck/plc-2.0v2/bin/clik_profile.sh

I run with the default compilers, no need to submit the job, can be launched directly in terminal. Normally it runs for a few hours and then produces a segfault.
