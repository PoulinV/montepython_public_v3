# note concerning the Planck 2018 likelihood:
# This likelihood has a nuisance parameter A_planck that should be declared in
# your input parameter file.
# Usually this likelihood is used in combination with the highl likelihood,
# which imposes a gaussian prior on this nuisance parameter.
# If you run this likelihood alone (without any highl one), you need to
# impose the gaussian prior here. In that case, uncomment the two lines:
#Planck_highl.A_planck_prior_center            = 1
#Planck_highl.A_planck_prior_variance          = 0.0025
