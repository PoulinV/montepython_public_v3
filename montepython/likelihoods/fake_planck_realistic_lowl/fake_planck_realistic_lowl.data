# This is a fake Planck Gaussian likelihood, to be
# used in error forecasts with a MontePython-generated
# fiducial model, not containing any actual Planck data,
# but with a fair estimate of the Planck noise spectrum
# for the full Planck mission.

# Full sky and l_max = 50 for combining with cmb_s4_highl and
# fake_planck_realistic_highl_fsky0p17 as in
# Brinckmann, Hooper et al. 1808.05955
# Should not be combined with other lowl or highl likelihoods!

# This likelihood is based on the fake_planck_bluebook
# likelihood, modified by T. Brinckmann and S. Clesse
# adding extra options implemented for the core_m5 papers,
# e.g. lensing extraction, de-lensing, or B-modes.
