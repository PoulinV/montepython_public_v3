# This is a fake Planck Gaussian likelihood, to be
# used in error forecasts with a MontePython-generated
# fiducial model, not containing any actual Planck data,
# but with a fair estimate of the Planck noise spectrum
# for the full Planck mission. This likelihood is based
# on the fake_planck_bluebook likelihood, with extra
# options implemented for the core_m5 papers, e.g.
# lensing extraction, de-lensing, or B-modes.
