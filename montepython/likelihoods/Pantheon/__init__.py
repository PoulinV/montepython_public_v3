.. module:: Pantheon
    :synopsis: Pantheon likelihood from Jones et al. 2018 and Scolnic et al. 2018

.. moduleauthor:: Rodrigo von Marttens <rodrigovonmarttens@gmail.com> and Antonella Cid <antonellacidm@gmail.com>

Based on the previous JLA likelihood writted by Benjamin Audren

.. code::

    C00 = mag_covmat_file
    
.. note::

    Since there are a lot of file manipulation involved, the "pandas" library
    has to be installed -- it is an 8-fold improvement in speed over numpy, and
    a 2-fold improvement over a fast Python implementation. The "numexpr"
    library is also needed for doing the fast array manipulations, done with
    blas daxpy function in the original c++ code. Both can be installed with
    pip (Python package manager) easily.
