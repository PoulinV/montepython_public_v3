# CMB-S4 likelihood from Brinckmann, Hooper et al. 1808.05955

# This likelihood is based on the core_m5 likelihood, which
# in turn builds on the fake planck bluebook likelihood with
# modifications by T. Brinckmann and S. Clesse to include B-modes and
# the CMB lensing potential. It is possible to use the lensing
# auto- or cross-correlations alone, in combination with temperature
# and polarization, or for delensing the temperature and polarization
# spectra (e.g. if both lensing and B-mode polarization is desired)

# Experimental configuration based on CMB-S4 science book (1610.02743)
