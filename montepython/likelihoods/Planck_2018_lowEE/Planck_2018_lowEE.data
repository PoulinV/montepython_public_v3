# for Planck 2013 release:
#Planck_2018_lowEE.path_clik = os.path.join(data.path['clik'], '../commander_v4.1_lm49.clik')

# for the Planck 2015 release (baseline):
Planck_2018_lowEE.path_clik = os.path.join(data.path['clik'], '../plc_3.0/low_l/simall/simall_100x143_offlike5_EE_Aplanck_B.clik')

# note concerning the Planck 2015 likelihood:
# This likelihood has a nuisance parameter A_planck that should be declared in
# your input parameter file.
# Usually this likelihood is used in combination with the highl likelihood,
# which imposes a gaussian prior on this nuisance parameter.
# If you run this likelihood alone (without the highl one), you need to
# impose the gaussian prior here. In that case, uncomment the two lines:
#Planck_highl.A_planck_prior_center            = 1
#Planck_highl.A_planck_prior_variance          = 0.0025
