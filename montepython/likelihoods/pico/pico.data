# PICO likelihood from Brinckmann, Hooper et al. 1808.05955

# This likelihood is based on the core_m5 likelihood, which
# in turn builds on the fake planck bluebook likelihood with
# modifications by T. Brinckmann and S. Clesse to include B-modes and
# the CMB lensing potential. It is possible to use the lensing
# auto- or cross-correlations alone, in combination with temperature
# and polarization, or for delensing the temperature and polarization
# spectra (e.g. if both lensing and B-mode polarization is desired)

# Experimental configuration based on Sutin et al. 1808.01368 and
# Young et al. 1808.01369 with values taken from
# https://zzz.physics.umn.edu/ipsig/baseline
