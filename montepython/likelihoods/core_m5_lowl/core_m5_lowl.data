# CORE M5 is modelled as in the CORE papers for the M5 ESA proposal:
# Di Valentino et al. 1612.00021 and Finelli et al. 1612.08270

# Full sky and l_max = 50 for combining with cmb_s4_highl and
# core_m5_highl_fsky0p3 as in Brinckmann, Hooper et al. 1808.05955
# Should not be combined with other lowl or highl likelihoods!

# This likelihood builds on the fake planck bluebook likelihood,
# modified by T. Brinckmann and S. Clesse to include B-modes and
# the CMB lensing potential. It is possible to use the lensing
# auto- or cross-correlations alone, in combination with temperature
# and polarization, or for delensing the temperature and polarization
# spectra (e.g. if both lensing and B-mode polarization is desired)

# Updated noise file using minimum variance noise estimate
# from Brinckmann, Hooper et al. 1808.05955
