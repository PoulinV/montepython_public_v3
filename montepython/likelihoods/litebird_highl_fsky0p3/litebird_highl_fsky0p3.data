# LiteBIRD likelihood following approach of the CORE-M5 papers
# for the M5 ESA proposal: Di Valentino et al. 1612.00021 and
# Finelli et al. 1612.08270.

# Partial sky and l_min = 51 for combining with cmb_s4_highl and
# litebird_lowl as in Brinckmann, Hooper et al. 1808.05955
# Should not be combined with other lowl or highl likelihoods!

# This likelihood builds on the fake planck bluebook likelihood,
# modified by T. Brinckmann and S. Clesse to include B-modes and
# the CMB lensing potential. It is possible to use the lensing
# auto- or cross-correlations alone, in combination with temperature
# and polarization, or for delensing the temperature and polarization
# spectra (e.g. if both lensing and B-mode polarization is desired)
